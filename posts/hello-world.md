# Hello World

## What is this?

MLH INIT got me to update my personal website for one of the challenges, and I
decided to take the opportunity to start my long-delayed blog.

## How it's built

These pages are rendered from markdown files, using `remark-html`. This way I
can manage content with just Typora + git + filesystem.

The frontmatter data is parsed with `gray-matter` to generate the list of posts.

It integrates with "dynamic" routing in the wider Next.js app that constitutes
this website, which is then exported with static generation (that is why
"dynamic" is quoted).

## So what's next?

Unfortunately, so I can turn over this challenge there is not much real content
here for the first post, but my plan for the blog in the near future includes:

- Book notes
- Reflections on CS education and becoming a software engineer
- Technical posts on projects I'm working on
